# Profile Card

This project is a dynamic and responsive digital profile card built with modern web technologies. It's designed to elegantly showcase personal information, including a name, a short biography, hobbies, dislikes, and social media links. A live-updating clock displays the current time.

This project is bundled using Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the card.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality, such as the real-time clock.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.
- `src/main.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for updating the time.
- `src/style.css`: Contains all the styles for the profile card.
- `src/assets/`: Holds the SVG icons for the social media links.
- `public/`: Stores static assets that are directly served.
